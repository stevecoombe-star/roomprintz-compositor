# Measurement calibration experiment (ARCHIVED)

## Summary
We implemented a calibration pipeline (ceiling height + segment) to influence staging scale.

## Outcome (why archived)
- Extreme measurements did not reliably change furniture scale.
- Red overlay/arrowheads occasionally leaked into final output.
Conclusion: model did not bind to measurements strongly enough for production.
